        <p class="svelte-oauysb"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->There’s a dilemma, a game theoretic tradeoff between the world we have now and an idealistic one that most social activists dream of where everyone can be equal. I think it’s the gov’s job to provide things that should be obvious like UBI affordable housing & health care as well as better infrastructure to pick up ppl who fall off the ladder rather than for-profit prisons. and pharmaceuticals
but at the same time that access to wealth for innovative types who create goods/services should be used to hire labor at competitive prices, so yes the minimum wage should be hire but i don’t think humans are smart enough to elect politicians who will fix things for them anytime soon, and also there’s another dilemma where it’s legal io buy policy.
so in summary I think markets still need to exist, which will naturally create some ppl who have more than others, but at the same time there needs to be regulation that evens it out more. The only way this will inevitably be forced upon us imo is when most jobs become to get automated or when humans come together to realize they need power over monetary policy (imo the most important thing ppl would be advocating for, if they realized this, is a new standard of checks & balances the federal reserve as if it were a 4th branch of government).<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
      </div><div class="step svelte-oauysb">
        <p class="svelte-oauysb"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Banother way to “force” better equality in the same capitalistic system is for there to be some way for the people on the lower end of the spectrum to put their money together and control inflationary forces through competition. This is only possible at a mass scale fir the 1st time since the advent of the internet so I’ve never heard someone suggest this but the easiest way is through something that resembles a new type of bank. Imagine if everyone in a community put their money together to buy things in bulk, it would for prices of things that were previously more expensive at the store to get cheaper through because competition would force companies to lower their excessive margins (price it takes to produce/buy something in bulk vs the price they sell them for individually). Now imagine an app where ppl that need these savings deposit their money for the month to a pool fund like a bank. You could even make it enticing for them to do so by offering a decent interest rate
to put it in a better way, I dont think anything will get solved anytime soon through policy or ppl coming together because theyre too dumb to even realize the issues (conservatives holding every1 back especially). The fact that paying politicians is still legal and that’s not a huge topic on the ballots shows this. Things will happen slowly through technological innovations like automation displacing everyone forcing UBI or crypto becoming an alternative to fiat making the FED realize they need better monetary policy or making ppl realize the most important thing (power of issuing money) is in the hands of a select few who have just been pushing things worse for the past 50 years as you can see by the increasing wealth gap while assets are pumped by them to unrealistic prices which makes all the rich wanna horde their wealth in appreciating assets, namely <span class=bolded>stocks and real estate as a hedge against a depreciating currency</span>.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

well everyone implicitly agrees on money being worth something otherwise rich people’s money would be worthless because we outnumber them and could technically all agree to stop using it lol. but collective decisionmaking has never been possible like it is now with the advent of the internet so i dont think that was possible till now but the crypto movement is a step in that direction that gives checks & balances to the monetary policy of the US but i’m getting off point lol

by the way im not defending rich people by what im about to say lmao i actually agree with your message but i think it’s unrealistic without a couple of things:

Inequality would still naturally arise based on things like celebrityism & groupthink for example Rihanna became a billionaire of of Fenty because millions of girls recognizing her as a celebrity and buying her product <span>because it brings value to their lives.</span> Reason I say it should be somewhere in between is because there are pros and cons to each system: capitalistic societies are exponentially more productive with greater output than their counterpart because of that living conditions for everyone compared to a century ago are drastically better and, for example, 99% of young adults are “well-off” enough to afford a palm-sized computer that gives them access to all the information in human history. (not saying this is exactlywhat you believe but just speaking of the 2 extreme sides) It’s unrealistic to say that an Elon Musk type who’s working to advance society like this and, through market forces, drives the prices of computers downto the point that everyone is able to afford a phone or electric car(eventually) should have the exact same access to wealth as someone who is a maid, or even a celeb.But at the same time the individualistic mindset has become so bad that there’s no safety net for those at the bottom which there should be.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>

      </div></div></div>

<div class="conclusion svelte-18tnry9"><p class="svelte-18tnry9"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->There's a reason why libertarian tech heads are obsessed with co-opting the word "freedom". It is because in their ideology it has been the most challenging concept to completely commodify, and so they are constantly trying to shift the definition from ordinary people's ideas of equality and access to resources and the commons, to one of "free markets" and "freedom of property rights" and "freedom from centralisation" (i.e. state-funded access).<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-18tnry9"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Their ideas are anti-freedom dressed up in superficial radical language that is just a post-capitalist endgame of having consumers imprison themselves in enclosed hyper-realities designed by the rich. They hope you will elect for convenience, slogans and idealism over our own collective future on the earth, a future which is plagued with real inequities and material problems they do not want to address and do not want you to pay attention to.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p class="svelte-18tnry9"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --> But even then, I think many dont really understand how important cryptocurrencies and the blockchain are for not so wealthy countries. They are an opportunity to skip many of the hurdles associated with FIAT money. A few examples are: Traceability, control for the user and transferability. This is extremly important for third world countries. Almost nobody in China or Africa uses a debit or credit card, they all use services on their phone to pay and wire money. Especially in more rural parts of africa that is often the only opportunity for people to get loans or transfer money in any way. <!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>
